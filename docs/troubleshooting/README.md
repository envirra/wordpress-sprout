## Migrate To Version 2.x

Since **${var.theme-name}** 2.x has newly architecture to support future of magazine site, Migration from older **${var.theme-name}** version (1.x or earlier) is not strongly recommended. If you want to use **${var.theme-name}** 2.x with the site that created with older **${var.theme-name}** version, Please note that the following data cannot be used in the new **${var.theme-name}** version and you need to re-entry these data by manual.

* Review data
* Post options
* Page options
* Sidebars
* Widgets (Only theme's widgets)
* Theme options
* Extra options provided by theme

Anyway, We still support **${var.theme-name}** 1.x for Wordpress compatibility and security issues until December 31, 2021. If an update for **${var.theme-name}** 1.x is available, It will be included in the full package zip file (Please download All files from ThemeForest download page and the updated theme file will be located inside the zip file).
