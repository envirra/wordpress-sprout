# Using WPML with the Theme

[WPML](https://wpml.org/) makes it easy to run a multilingual website with a single WordPress installation. It comes with over 40 languages. You can also add your own language variants (like Canadian French or Mexican Spanish) using WPML’s languages editor. You can arrange different language contents in the same domain (in language directories), in sub-domains or in completely different domains.

You can find more information in [getting started guide on WPML website.](http://wpml.org/documentation/getting-started-guide/)

### Important WPML Components

You can enhance your site translation process using these add-on plugins (please note: all of following add-ons are part of WPML Multilingual CMS package):

* **Translation Management** With this component you can bring more organization into translation process of your site. You can view all types of content with translation status info in one place. Also you can manage people in your team or use translation service right from the translation dashboard. More information here: [usage guide](https://wpml.org/documentation/translating-your-contents/using-the-translation-editor/) and [feature overview](https://wpml.org/documentation/translating-your-contents/using-the-translation-editor/translation-management-features/).

* **String Translation** This component helps you to translate anything that doesn’t fall inside posts, pages or taxonomy. This includes the site’s tagline, general texts in Admin screens, widget titles and many other texts.
